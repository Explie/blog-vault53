Hello everybody,

this is just a quick update to my first incident response playbook which does cover the topic `Ransomware`. For the last couple of months I have written on this one, and it's finally ready for publishing in the first more or less final version.

You'll find it in my GitHub repo [DFIR Playbooks][dfir-playbooks-repo] exactly here: [Incident Response Playbook - Ransomware Infection][ransomware-playbook]

In the next days or weeks I will follow up with a short blog post about how to use my repo and where I am planning to go with it and what to expect next. Stay tuned.

As always I am very grateful for any advice, extension or general chatter about my work. Just leave me a mail or make a pull request or issue the corresponding repository on GitHub.

Best Regards

Tobias
