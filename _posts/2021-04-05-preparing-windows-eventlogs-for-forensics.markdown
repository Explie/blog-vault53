Hello world,

the next couple of weeks I want to blog a little bit about Windows eventlogs and why you should care about them.

During my work as forensic investigator I often seek information and from them and even more often I have to realize that the information I need is already overwritten or wasn't logged in the first place. 

To tackle this problem and help you out there to get more from of your windows system logs I start a little series in the next weeks (hopefully not months) consisting of the following topics: 

1. [What are the Windows eventlogs and why should you care?][what-are-eventlogs-post]
2. Increasing the Windows eventlog size for selected logs **(tbd)**
3. Additional eventlogs to activate and Microsoft Sysmon **(tbd)**
4. Log aggregation for windows eventlogs **(tbd)**

_(I will update the list with links to the posts and new stuff on the run)_

When you think something is missing or have another question drop me a fast issue or mail and I will see what I can do.

Best and stay healthy  
Tobias
